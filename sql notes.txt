First Normal Form (1NF) - Table faithfully represents a relation and has no repeating groups.
Second Normal Form (2NF) - No non-prime attribute int he table is functionally dependent on a proper subset of a candidate key.
Third Normal Form (3NF) - Every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key in the table.
Fourth Normal Form ($NF) - Every non-trivial multivalues dependency in the table is a dependency on a superkey.
Fifth Normal Form (5NF) - Every non-trivial join dependency in the table is implied by the superkeys of the table.


When writing SQL code, it is NOT recommended to follow the ANSI SQL standard so the work can be ported between databases
SQL - Structured Query Language
SQL Keywords are NOT case sensitive
A RESULT-SET represents he data extracted from a query
DBMS - Database Management System
ALIGN is NOT a query language keyword
UNDER is NOT a SQL Keyword
A TABLE in database terms, is a collection of closely related columns
Miniature Database is NOT a database type
ORDER BY is the syntax for sorting data after a query runs
GROUP BY is used when aggregating data together
TOTAL is NOT an aggregate function in SQL
SELECT x    FROM table    GROUP BY x - is the same as SELECT DISTINCT x    FROM table
The CREATE keyword is used to build a database, table, view, and index
It is not required for every database table to have a PRIMARY KEY
SELECT name AS THE_DESIRED_NAME    FROM table - creates an alias for the name field
The DESC keyword sorts data from largest to smallest in a query
The INSERT keyword is used to add data to a table
The UPDATE keyword is used to modift data within a table
WHERE a BETWEEN x AND y -- is the same as -- a>(x-1) AND a<(y+1)
SELECT name, MIN(a)    FROM table -- is not enough information to determine where name is pulled from
No matter how many fields are in a SELECT statement, it is all in ONE ROW
In a query with a GROUP BY, HAVING and WHERE produce the same result
When using a CREATE TABLE, STRING is not given as an option to represent the datatype of a field
INNER JOIN produces an INTERSECTION of a dataset
The maximum number of table that can be joined together in a single SQL statement is DATABASE DEPENDENT
When using an INNER JOIN on two table, the result is every row where the key used in the join is in both tables
INDEXES are used to make database queries more efficient and quicker
A primary key MUST be unique
A primary key CAN be made of multiple columns
UPDATE is used to modify a group
The ALTER TABLE keywords are used to add, modify, or drop/delete columns in a database table
DELETE and DROP BOTH remove data from the table, DROP removes the schema, table, and constraints
DDL - Data Definition Language
DDL changes the structure of the database, DML manages the data in the database
PRODUCT is NOT an aggregate function in SQL
TRUNCATE and DELETE both remove all data, DELETE can be use din conjunction with a WHERE to only delete specific data
A foreign key can NOT be made up of multiple columns
WHERE x LIKE "Y%" -- gets every x, that starts with 'Y'
VARCHAR is preferable as a data type a majority of the time because it saves space by not allocating space that may never be used
Given table a and table b, a foreign key would be table (b.AN_IDENTICAL_COLUMN) (b.numberOfItemsBought)
A LEFT OUTER JOIN would make the left column show up as non-null
If you are looking for someone with one item -- SELECT lastName, COUNT(numBought)    FROM x INNER JOIN yONx.xID=y.yID GROUP BY x.ID
Referential integrity can NOT use STRINGs
36/50-ish - 36/50-ish - 36/50-ish - 36/50-ish - 36/50-ish - 36/50-ish -- (21-22)



IF A TRUE OR FALSE QUESTION REPEATS, GUESS TRUE FOR ONE, AND FALSE FOR THE OTHER

RDBMS - relation database management systems
Transact SQL - T-SQL

every row is an instance
columns hold the values for each attribute of the instance
a field is the intersection of a row and a column

4 types of commands - deals with transactions and locking

data manipulation language (DML)
data definition language (DDL)
transaction control language (TCL)
data control language (DCL)

four standard database isolation levels are
read uncommited
read commited
serializable
repeatable read

Arithmetic + - * /
Concatenation +
Comparison <, <=, >, >=, <>
is (not) null, like, (not) in
(not) between
not
and
or


Order by clause
	The default sort order is ascending
	Numeric values are displayed lowest to highest
	Date values are displayed with the earliest value first
	Character values are displayed in alphabetical order
	NULL values are displayed last in ascending order and first in descending order
	NULLS FIRST specifies that NULL values should be returned before non-NULL values
	NULLS LAST specifies that NULL values should be returned after non-NULL values

Three types of join
	-inner
	-outer
		-left outer - everything selected from the left table, even if there are no matches
		-right outer - everything selected from the right table, even if there are no matches
		-full outer - everything selected from both tables, even if there are no matches
	-cross


--SUBQUERIES

	--Result of one query used in another query
	--Work from inside-out (there are expections)
	--Order Query and Inner Query

	  --Subqueries can be
		--simple
		--correlated
	  --Subqueries can return:
		--scalar
		--multi-valued
		--table-valued

	  --Simple subqqueries return a single result set used by the outer query:
		--Single Value, List of values from a single column or T/F
	  --Correlated Subquery
		--Depends on a value from the outer query

--Subqueries versus Joins
	--Most can be written either way
	  --Joins perform faster (according to some)
	  --Subqueries are easier to read (according to some)
	--MS says no difference if done properly
	  --subqueries that check for existence of date - USE JOIN
	    --indexes make them faster in that case
	--Get it done - optimize it later if needed

--Scalar Subquery - Returns one value
--Multivalued Subquery - 

--Single value vs.  Multi value 
	--Notice '=' vs. 'in'
 
 
	--Common Subquery formats:
 
		--WHERE expression [NOT] IN (subquery)
 
		--WHERE expression comparison_operator [ANY | ALL] (subquery)
 
		--WHERE [NOT] EXISTS (subquery)

--Correlated
	--Tough
	--Learn to recognize
	
	--Which sales person has an order with totaldue > $150K?
	
	--Using Join
	SELECT DISTINCT p.BusinessEntityId, p.FirstName + ' ' + p.LastName Name
	FROM Person.Person p
	JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader s
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = s.SalesPersonID
	WHERE s.TotalDue > 150000
	
	--Using Correlated Subquery (notice alias in out query)
	SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.FirstName + ' ' + p.LastName NAME
	FROM Person.Person p
	WHERE EXISTS
		(SELECT s.SalesPersonID
		 FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader s
		 WHERE TotalDue > 150000
		 AND p.BusinessEntityID = s.SalesPersonID)
	
	--Notice outer table referenced in inner query	 
	--Inner query can use * since we are only looking for existence
	--Inner query runs repeatedly for each outer result




--Common Subquery Formats:
	--WHERE expression [NOT] IN (subquery)
	--WHERE expression comparison_operator [ANY/ALL] (subquery)
	--WHERE [NOT] EXISTS (subquery)

WHEN WERE USING SOMETHING FORM THE OUTSIDE QUERY IN THE INNER QUERY, IT RUNS DIFFERENTLY
IT DOESNT DO THE SUBQUERY THEN THE OUTSIDE QUERY

WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FIRST LINE OF THE OUTSIDE QUERY RUNS 
THEN IT DOES THE INSIDE QUERY TO SEE IF IT MATCHES
IT GOES AND DOES THE NEXT LINE OF THE OUTSIDE QUERY 
DOES THE INSIDE QUERY TO SEE IF IT MATCHES
THIRD LINE OUTSIDE
LOOKS FOR MATCH




The SQL keyword that enables you to be able to change columns within a table is ALTER
A table column within common database terms is also considered as a FIELD
ECL - Emitter-Coupled Logic
Each table within a database must have A UNIQUE NAME
A primary key much contain A UNIQUE VALUE FOR EACH ROW OF DATA, and CANNOT CONTAIN NULL VALUES
A foreign key links between a field in one table to a field in another table.
TINYTEXT is NOT a character string data type in SQL Server
DATEOFFSET is NOT a Date and Time data type within SQL Server
VARBINARY is NOT a numeric data type within SQL Server
DOMAIN - the possible value of an attribute, i.e. column
Primary keys, defualt values, and data types should be considered when making a table within SQL
A characteristic of an RDBMS is "tables are linked by common data known as keys"
DATA SET is an item that can store data from various databases to be used as a fast table in memory to read and write data from
A database schema defines the tables, field in each table, and relationships between fields and tables
GUID - Global Unique Identifier
DAL(Data Abstraction Language) is NOT a category of SQL commands

DAC(Data Administration Commands) is a category of SQL commands
TCC(Transactional Control Commands) is a category of SQL commands
DQL(Data Query Language) is a category of SQL commands
Both table need a primary key, and the foregein key needs to be placed in the table that is referencing the other table when representing a 1:M relationship in a relational database design
Primary key constraints ensure ENTITY INTEGRITY
ATTRIBUTE INTEGRITY is NOT a category of data integrity
The DROP command is used to either frop a database or table from the server
CREATE TABLE orders(orderID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY) creates a table names "Orders" with a primary key names "orderID"
PRIMARY KEY (Name, Address) defines a COMPOSITE KEY
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, as well as all modern database systems except MongoDB
INSERT is an example of a DML command
A stored program that is attached to a table or view is called a STORED PROCEDURE
Permissions is NOT removed by the DROP TABLE in SQL Server
Bitwise constraints is inconsistent with Domain information
Aggregate functions can be sed as expressions in the select list of a SELECT statement
Two common wildcard characters within SQL Percent Sign (%), Underscore (_)
SQL query and modification commands make up a DML
The language available in SQL Server that adds programming constructs to the SQL Language is known as (TSQL) TRANSACT-SQL
In MS SQL, the parameter added to a field in order to auto increment that field is IDENTITY
The identifier of the entity becomes the PRIMARY KEY of the corresponding table
A table's Permissions are a set of defined levels of access to a securable and area pplied individually or collectively to a securable.
